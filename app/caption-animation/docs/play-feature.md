Hereâ€™s the implementation plan for adding a "play mode" to your caption animation tool:

Play Mode Implementation Plan

Add Play Mode State

Add a global or parent-level state (e.g., isPlayMode: boolean) to toggle between editor mode and play mode.
UI Toggle

Add a button (e.g., "Play" or "Preview Fullscreen") in the editor panel to switch to play mode.
In play mode, hide the editor and control panel UI, showing only the animation preview.
Full-Size Preview

In play mode, render the preview at the actual virtual dimensions (e.g., 1280x720), not scaled or constrained by the aspect-ratio container.
Center the preview on the page, possibly with a dark background for focus.
Playback Logic

Implement logic to animate through all lines and their words in sequence:
Animate each word in a line with its effect and duration.
After the last word in a line, automatically advance to the next line.
Continue until all lines are played.
Optionally, add a "replay" or "exit play mode" button.
Animation Control

Use a timer or animation sequencing (e.g., with setTimeout or a state machine) to control the timing of word and line transitions.
Ensure all effects and durations are respected.
Exit Play Mode

Allow the user to exit play mode (e.g., with an "Exit" button or pressing Escape), returning to the editor view.
Result:
When the user enters play mode, the UI hides the editor and shows a full-size, real-dimension preview that animates all lines and words in sequence, just as it would appear in a final export.
